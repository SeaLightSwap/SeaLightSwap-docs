# SeaLightSwap

##

SeaLightSwap is a Polygon infrastructure project that builds liquidity for layer-one blockchains, AMMs and partnering projects. Launching on Polygon.

Since DEXs do not use order-books and instead use an automated market maker (AMM) mechanism, the exchange requires the use of liquidity pools, which come from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their token pairs in "Pools" on the DEX. In exchange, they receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens. These LP tokens will be used in farm soon.

Fees Are 0.3% For Liquidity Providers.
